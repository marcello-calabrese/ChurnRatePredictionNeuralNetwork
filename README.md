# ChurnRatePredictionNeuralNetwork

## Neural Network model built through Keras Tensorflow to predict client churn of a Bank company

## Action Plan:

- Data understanding
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Prepare Dataset for model building:
    - Take Care of categorical data
    - Data Scaling
    - Split data between features and label
- Model Building:
    - Split between training and test set
    - Build Model using Keras Sequential API
    - Compile Keras Model
    - Train Model
    - Measure Model Performance
- Predict Churn
